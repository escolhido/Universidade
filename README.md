# University

This repository holds resolutions for some of the exercises solved over my last years of university. All of this exercises are related to either _formal methods_ or _distributed systems_, which are the two major courses I attended during my masters degree.

*Some* of the projects I developed in university can be found in other repositories: 

#### Year #1

- [Computer Labs I (Haskell)](https://github.com/dinispeixoto/LI1) - based on the puzzle game _LightBot_.

#### Year #2

- [Object Oriented Programming (Java)](https://github.com/marcelo140/POO) - implementation a local auction house.
- [Operating Systems (C)](https://github.com/9thScientist/SO) - backup system with deduplication using a client and a daemon using pipes and such.
- [Progam Calculus (Haskell)](https://github.com/marcelo140/CP) - unit testing and quickchecking a graph library.
- [Computer Labs III (C)](https://github.com/marcelo140/LI3) - query an in-memory representation of a supermarket. The input could go up to 5 million lines.
- [Computer Labs III (Java)](https://github.com/marcelo140/LI3_JAVA) - query an in-memory representation of a supermarket. The input could go up to 5 million lines.

#### Year #3

- [Distributed Systems (Java)](https://github.com/9thScientist/SD) - auction house with multi-threaded server and clients.
- [Development of Software Systems (Java)](https://github.com/9thScientist/DSS) - planning and development of a system to solve expense sharing.
- [Language Processing (Gawk)](https://github.com/9thScientist/PL) - text processor that parses a XML document into HTML pages for data visualization.
- [Language Processing (Flex)](https://github.com/9thScientist/PL-FLINT) - text processor that generates C code from "C with template strings".
- [Language Processing (Yacc)](https://github.com/9thScientist/PL_VILAN) - compiler for a simple imperative language we designed.
- [Knowledge and Reasoning Representation (Prolog, R)](https://github.com/marcelo140/SRCR) - prolog reasoning system (ternary logic) + neural networks in R.
- [Computer Labs IV (C#)](https://github.com/marcelo140/Ambrosium) - planning and development of a system to find food near you according to your tastes.
- [Computer Graphics (C++)](https://github.com/zesilva63/CG) - 3D engine with a solar system as proof of work.
- [Computer Communications (Rust)](https://github.com/marcelo140/CC) - TCP reverse proxy with monitorization and load balancing.

#### Year #4

- [Paralell Computing (C)](https://github.com/marcelo140/histogram-equalization) - parallelizing a histogram equalization algorithm.
- [Specification and Modelling (NuSMV)](https://github.com/marcelo140/landing-system) - modelling and verifying a landing system.
- [Specification and Modelling (Alloy)](https://github.com/marcelo140/monopoly) - modelling and verifying some of the monopoly rules.
- [Fundamentals of Distributed Systems (Java)](https://github.com/9thScientist/FSD) - distributed objects API with transactions and 2-phase commit.
- [Paradigms of Distributed Systems (Erlang, Java)](https://github.com/zesilva63/PSD) - stack exchange mixing multiple distributed architectures.
